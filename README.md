# Jest (vanity) builder for Angular

You have an existing project and integrated `Jest` all by yourself?  
**Awesome**.

Your `ng test` command is broken and you can not use any builder (be it [@nrwl/jest](https://duckduckgo.com) or [@angular-builders/jest](https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/tree/master/packages/jest))
Help is underway.
